// for each day create a new branch of the lab using the following naming conventions class##-feature



//1 store min/max hourly and average cookies per customer in object properties

//2 method of store object to generate a random number of customers per hour use random math generator.

//3 calculate and store simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour per location using cookies purchase and the random number of customers

//4 store the results for each location in a seperate array make as a property of the object representing that location


//Display the values of each array as unordered list in browser

//Claculating the sum of these hourly totals output for each location 

//

// locations and time

//string numbers for objects

//shop locatiions



//simulated amount of cookies
